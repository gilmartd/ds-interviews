I explored some aspects that are normally known and tried to prove it with the help of the AI to fill in My
knowledge gaps. I know a little bit about turbidity from past experience and I understand that it increases with extra "churning" which can be caused
by rainfall. I used a linear regression using python's DoWhy library to try and validate my suspicion that increased rainfall increased turbity with the 
dataset. Because other things can affect rainfall and turbidity, like wind or water velocity, those needed to be input into the causal model as well. I
have never used these tools before so I would need to prove to myself the validity of the output but the AI helped me get a good starting point and 
get me moving with the data.
