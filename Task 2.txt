See modular.py for code
Summary Stastics shows the general info on the dataset
Missing_values_percentage shows the graph of missing values by column
distributions_page 1-3 show the individual graphs for the data columns for user interpretation



Of note: I used a winsorization method for the outliers which is why each graph has tall bars at the beginning and end.
